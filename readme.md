# FLNI

This is the firmware-linux-nonfree installer. 
Binary firmware is a pain, but a necessary evil for driver support for linux on most modern hardware. 

To install: download flni-main.zip from the Code button above, unpack, and run "make install"

To use: run "update-firmware-nonfree"

Developed for, and tested on, Debian 10 (buster); will probably work unmodified on any debian derivative.

Coming soon: command line switches! better documentation! big-screen license warnings! surround sound! Ok, maybe not the last one.
